Here is the summary of requirements. Please go through , discuss amongst  your team and reach out to me when you need any clarifications. The goal should be to make this design generic enough so that it can be implemented for any customer without many changes. If you have better ideas feel free to setup a call to discuss.

1.     Channels

    Email inbox  eg. timesheets@tbs-team.com

    Network / Google Drive

2.     Frequency of Timesheets

    Some employees/consultants are required to submit weekly

    Some bi-weekly, some Monthly

Make this a config item. Regardless the frequency, all timesheets will be weekly.

When employees send monthly – Month start / end may be different than Weekly start / end days. Eg. If Month starts on Wednesday the first week time sheet will start on a Wednesday and end on the configured week end day. The same with Month end as well.

3.     Week start/end days   (Sunday – Saturday or Monday – Sunday)

Make this a config item.

4.     Holiday/Business Calendar

Make this a config item

5.     Overtime allowed/disallowed  for each employee

Make this a config item

6.      All the timesheets may be in different formats/layouts

Excel, PDF should be allowed

7.     If timesheets are not received from an employee an email reminder should be sent automatically.    Make this a config item – after how many days of delay and the reminder is optional.

8.     Database – Employee information need to be maintained in a database / spreadsheet

 

Notifications/alerts

1.     When timesheet is not received

2.     When timesheet is received but not approved

3.     When timesheet is received but the number of hours is not acceptable (eg. Hours logged on a holiday, hours logged more than standard 8 hours)

4.     When all the timesheets are received for the month, notify accounts team to invoice the clients.

 

Output

1.     A consolidated list of all employees with their hours by the day. Shoud be broken down by week, weekly total hours, monthly total hours.

 

Name of employee

Client

 Week start / end

  Date

  Hours

  Approved by

  Total Hours for the week

 

 

The goal is to use the consolidated output sheet to generate invoices , upload the spreadsheet into a timekeeping/accounting software such as QuickBooks, Zoho , or ERPs.
